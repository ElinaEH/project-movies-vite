# Movie Site Project
This weeks project was to fetch data from themoviedb.org's API and display the data (movies) on a dynamic site using react and react-router-dom.

### The Problem
This week I did a lot of research on sites like w3school etc. to really try to understand what I was doing. It was a bit hard at first to make both the URL links work with my API key but I managed to solve it after some browsing on the web. I took it step by step this week since I had a bit more time which I think was very helpful to stay focused and on track. The responsiveness I think is very hard and I think it looks okay now. If I had more time I would research a bit more on responsive design and work a bit more on that in my project. It doesn't look exactly as I see it in my head right now, on smaller screens. I did the desktop version first and therefor I think I made it harder for myself. Next week I'll do the mobile version first.
